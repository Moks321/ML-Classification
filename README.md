# ML-Classification
The analysis on this project includes:
  -A training set for buildiing a classsifier using cross-validation and a separate test set
  -Handles missing data for both numerical and categorical variables
  -Feature scaling based on the training set and applied to both the training set and test set
  -Recoding of categorical variables to enable their use in classification algorithms
  -Uses 10- fold-cross-validation applied to training set to build a classifier for SVM and LR
  -Compares the performance of two ML algorithms 
  -Feature selection
  -Recursive Feature Eliminiation
  -Tuning the hyper-parameters
